Select colors 

1. relation of variance to categories 
	- Calculate variance for each vector 
	- Find highest-lowest variance
	- Hypernyms for all words -wordnet
	- See how much overlap there is in the hypernyms of for example top x words and last x words.

2. reduce data to possible categories that we find
compare nearest neighbors with nearest neighbours of full semantic space. First on reduced 500dimension


3. BLESS evaluation.
