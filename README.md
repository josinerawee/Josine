# PLAN 



Select colors 

* relation of variance to categories 
	* Calculate variance for each vector 
	* Find highest-lowest variance
	* Hypernyms for all words -wordnet
	* See how much overlap there is in the hypernyms of for example top x words and last x words.

* reduce data to possible categories that we find
compare nearest neighbors with nearest neighbours of full semantic space. First on reduced 500dimension


* BLESS evaluation.
